# Csquare (C¬≤)

**Csquare (C¬≤)** is a super-hybrid programming toolkit that makes **C as simple as Scratch**, as **readable as Python**, and still as **blazingly fast and minimal as C/ASM**.  

It is not a new language, but a **smart header-only library (`csquare.h`)** that extends plain C with Scratch-like macros, Python-like syntax sugar, and optional inline ASM for ultimate performance.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîπ **Scratch-like simplicity**  
  Use macros like `repeat(n) { ‚Ä¶ }`, `forever { ‚Ä¶ }` to code like Scratch.

- üîπ **C-level speed**  
  Compiles down to **pure C**, no interpreter, no VM. Efficient and lightweight.

- üîπ **Python readability**  
  Syntax feels like pseudocode. Great for beginners and rapid prototyping.

- üîπ **Hybrid control**  
  Mix high-level macros with normal C whenever you need.  
  Drop to inline ASM for performance-critical code.

- üîπ **Raylib integration**  
  (Optional) `smotion.h` wrapper brings Scratch-style motion & graphics using Raylib.
