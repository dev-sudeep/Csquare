# Csquare (C¬≤)

**Csquare (C¬≤)** is a super-hybrid programming toolkit that makes **C as simple as Scratch**, as **readable as Python**, and still as **blazingly fast and minimal as C/ASM**.  

It is not a new language, but a **smart header-only library (`csquare.h`)** that extends plain C with Scratch-like macros, Python-like syntax sugar, and optional inline ASM for ultimate performance.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîπ **Scratch-like simplicity**  
  Use macros like `repeat(n) { ‚Ä¶ }`, `forever { ‚Ä¶ }` to code like Scratch.

- üîπ **C-level speed**  
  Compiles down to **pure C**, no interpreter, no VM. Efficient and lightweight.

- üîπ **Python readability**  
  Syntax feels like pseudocode. Great for beginners and rapid prototyping.

- üîπ **Hybrid control**  
  Mix high-level macros with normal C whenever you need.  
  Drop to inline ASM for performance-critical code.

- üîπ **PyGame grphics integration**  
  (Optional) `smotion.h` wrapper brings Scratch-style motion & graphics using the power of InPy and the PyGame library

## üñ•Ô∏è Example Code

```c
#include <csquare.h>
int main(){
    repeat(5, __i) {
        say("Hello, world! %d repeat\n", __i + 1);
        wait(1);
    }
    say("Hello world has been said 5 times!\n");
    char* result = inpy("print(2 + 2)");
    say("2 + 2 = %s\n", result);
    say("InPy says 2 + 2 = %s\n", result);
    
    say("Starting Pygame window...\n");
    sm_init();
    wait(0.5); // Increased delay for initialization
    
    say("Drawing shapes...\n");
    
    // Draw multiple shapes
    sm_draw("circle", "(255, 0, 0), (400, 300), 50");  // Red circle
    sm_draw("rect", "(0, 255, 0), pygame.Rect(200, 200, 100, 100)");  // Green square
    sm_draw("line", "(0, 0, 255), (100, 100), (700, 500), 5");  // Blue line with thickness 5
    
    // Keep window open
    say("Shapes drawn. Window will close in 10 seconds...\n");
    wait(10);
    
    sm_quit();
    return 0;
}
```
